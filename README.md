# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
A collection of coding projects created for the course
These are the following projects I have completed: 
  1. gpautomotive.html - which was a basic HTML one pager assignment
  2. AcedamyCinema.html - A html website but, with a bit of a touch. It contained everything I had learnt from Bootstrap, HTML and a bit of CSS as well.
  3. portfolio.html - This project was a mixture of everything; html, bootstrap and mainly css to target the styling on my websites a bit more. This one also is/will be public to my future employers.
